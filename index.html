<h2><a href = '#'> Grindstone</a></h2>

	<p> It's time to get back into the rabbit hole of programming.  I've done a bit of research into what developmental frameworks and languages to learn next.  

	While visiting my brother in San Francisco, two of his friends advised me on what to do next for my CS career.  Both are accomplished developers with sage advice.

	So, after finishing finals and having a bit more free-time, I've decided to dive into Javascript, AJAX, and any related languages.

	Cheers!  To a great summer, and to the sohpistication and development to this website.

	<h2><a href="#">Gone Home:  First Impressions</a></h2>
	
	
	
	<p>I only have a few hours of playtime through this game, but so far I've been impressed with the writing and with the subject material.  The supernatural element doesn't interest me, but I will have to play the game in its entirety to see how it's relevant. </p>

	<p> Samantha's story is an interesting and riveting tale of a high-school teen going through a phase of self-discovery. I've definitely already emotionally invested in her struggle to find her own place in the world, and love every single detail that she leaves behind in her mementos and letters.</p>

	<p> The supernatural element of the game seems...out of place for the moment.  I feel uneasy walking through the hallways of the house as a thunderstorm rages on outside of its walls...Maybe this was an intended effect?  I find myself liking the eerie atmosphere of the setting the longer I think about it.  I'd revisit the fact after completing the game.  So far, these clues to ghosts and hints of the supernatural are interrupting my love for Samanatha's story</p>

	<p>Can't wait to discover more.</p>
